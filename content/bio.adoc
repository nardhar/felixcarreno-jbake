I am 32 years old, and I love to work in a project that acomplishes its
purpose in the best possible way, although I sometimes overthing too much.

In my spare time I play videogames and do all kind of geek stuff, including
attempts of learning new things just for fun.

I am a free software supporter and believe that everything can be improved
when someone works with/for free software.
