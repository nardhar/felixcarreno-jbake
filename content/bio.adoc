I am 35 years old, and I love to work in a project that accomplishes its
purpose in the best possible way, obviously not everything ends up great
but I am always trying to improve myself and my code

In my spare time I play video games and do all kind of geek stuff, including
attempts of learning new things just for fun.

I am a free software supporter and believe that everything can be improved
when someone works with/for free software.
