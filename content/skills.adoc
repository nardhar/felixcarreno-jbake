I have worked with C++ (For ACM competing), Java, .NET Framework, Ruby on Rails
and PHP in the past, now I'm totally inmersed in Groovy, and of course Grails
Framework, why? because I think Groovy is a language that can simplify so many
things for the JVM, like this:

[source,groovy]
--
def isName = { it != 'software' }
assert ['felix', 'software', 'carreño'].inject([]) { fullName, name ->
    isName.call(name) ? fullName : fullName + [name.capitalize()]
}.join(' ') == 'Felix Carreño'
--

And Grails? well, it simplifies so many things from Spring Framework for
building web-apps, I feel it is like a plug and play development environment

Now I am learning other technologies, and better ways to integrate Grails with
them, it may be a rough road, but a nice challenge is always welcome
