I have worked with C++ (For ACM competing), Java, .NET Framework,
Ruby on Rails and PHP in the past, now I'm totally inmersed in Groovy,
and of course Grails Framework, why? because I think Groovy is a language
that can simplify so many things for the JVM, like this:

[source,groovy]
--
def isNickname = { it == 'nardhar' }
assert ['felix', 'nardhar', 'carreño'].inject([]) { fullName, name ->
    isNickname.call(name) ? fullName : fullName + [name.capitalize()]
}.join(' ') == 'Felix Carreño'
--

And Grails? well, it simplifies so many things from Spring Framework
for building web-apps, I feel it is like a plug and play development environment
